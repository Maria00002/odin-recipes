    <h3>Desciption</h3>
    <p>
        Ramen is a type of Japanese noodle soup. Every bowl of ramen has three
        main components: broth, noodles, and toppings. 
    </p>
    <p>There are four main ramen varieties named after the type of broth
        they use: shoyu, shio, miso, tonkotsu. Shoyu ramen, is made from a chicken broth 
        base flavored with soy sauce. Shio ramen features a thinner chicken broth seasoned
        with salt. Miso ramen is thicker and heartier, with a rich, brown broth flavored with miso,
        or fermented bean paste. And tonkotsu ramen is made from simmered pork
        bones, resulting in a thick, creamy, fatty broth. 
    </p>
    <p>The next element in any ramen dish are the noodles. These noodles can range
        from thin and curly to thick and straight. The final element of a ramen dish 
        is the toppings, and these vary widely by range. Some of the most common ramen
        toppings include thin slices of braised or roasted port called chashu; eggs prepared 
        in various ways, including hard and soft boiled, poached, and even raw;
        along with chopped scallions, sliced bamboo, dried seaweed, steamed fish cake, 
        canned corn, and pats or butter. This dish is traditionally eaten with chopsticks 
        along with a soup spoon for the broth.
